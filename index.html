    <title>Arsenal and Arteta</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Arsenal football club has a coach in Mikel Arteta who is ready to take the team to different levels but the media somehow forgets this and attack him after every loss or draw
</p>
<p>The players are showing grit and give their all to the team and everyone is competing to make the club great again. what is stopping Arsenal from winning the league? </p>
<p>People think this is the same Arsenal that lost the league but that's far from it. Brick by Brick he has built the squad and this team is made of winners</p>
 <p>People keep saying when will they win? some forgot how bad we use to be and how bad we use to play. Arteta is a visionary and i am happy he is at the helm at Arsenal</p>  
 <p>The club is now attractive and players now want to come to the club.We need to be grateful and not start giving ultimatum. We are winning the league this season.
    <p>Rival fans now fear that the team will succeed, they get excited over draws and we frown to it that is because Arteta has set a standard and i think we should be more appreciative.</p>
</p>
<p>Arteta is 100% winning the league</p>
<p>The Jamie Carragher's and Neville's of the world are the first to have opinions about us. When we win this league i hope Arteta gets his flowers he brought us from a pit a deep one</p>
<p>Arteta is finally going to win the league and everyone will understand why he won in the first place. We have done alot to get here and i am not shocked. Let us win together.</p>
